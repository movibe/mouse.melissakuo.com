The Studio Mouse
================
A parallax website detailing the true story of my fellow intern's life at CalArts.

The idea, outline, and illustrations were all done in Fall 2012 as part of Melissa's Interface Culture final project. Now, we've gone and brought it to life in just a couple nights!
